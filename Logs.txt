- [NOW] Basic combat, exploration, vision-triggered objectives
- [FIX] Find a way to make enemy not slide when IDLE and focusing on Camera
- [NOW] [DONE]Vision-Triggered objectives
    [=] Need to check if the obect is visible enough on the screen through the camera
    [=] Placing mutiple transforms around the objective to check which objective has been reached.
    [=] Basically a bounds check
        {+} Rigidbody?
            <~> Too costly, query every FixedUpdate unnecessarily
        {+} Position Check
            <~> This will also be called every Update
            <~> At least not as expensive as Physics Query
            <~> Who will trigger the event?
        {+} Using Camera
